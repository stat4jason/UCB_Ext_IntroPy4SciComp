Dataset Description-
LendingClub is the world’s largest peer-to-peer lending company, and it was the first peer-to-peer lender to register 
its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The dataset includes information on all loans 
issued from 2007 to 2015. The data consists of information on the lenders (“ability-to-pay” metrics such as credit score, 
length of employment, finance inquiries) as well as the loans themselves (loan status, loan amount, loan term, interest rate).
The dataset includes ~890,000 observations and 75 variables. 

Why we chose this project-
We chose this project because the correlations between lending habits and loan characteristics is an interesting topic. 
For instance, do people default on their loans because they take out too much, because they come from lower-income backgrounds,
or both? Do we see different lending habits in different geographical regions? These are questions we wish to explore.
Furthermore, the predictive aspect of this project is powerful. We can help LendingClub identify potential risky borrowers 
and make corresponding adjustment on payment schedule, loan pricing and capital reserve strategy. 

Goals (what we want to solve) & Project Plan (how we intend to solve it)-
Our goal is to perform descriptive and diagnostic data analysis, to get a better understanding of the relationship 
between lender traits and loan characteristics. We will analyze loans with “bad” loan status, 
and whether it seems to correlate with factors such as income level and loan amount. 
We will use scipy.stats to perform hypothesis testing, perhaps a 2-sample t-test, to compare two groups, 
lenders with bad loan status versus lenders with good loan status, and test whether differences 
between these groups is statistically significant. 
We will use LendingClub’s latest loan payment information, credit bureau information and other demographic 
information to predict whether a borrower will make an on-time loan payment. 
The outcome or target variable is a binary discrete variable with 1 represent any type of late payment/collection 
and 0 represent on-time payment or paid off. 
This is a binary classification supervised learning problem. 
Our plan is to fit logistic regression (regular machine learning technique) to compare the accuracy of the models. 

Final deliverable-
The outcome will be data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis using numpy, matplotlib, and scipy, 
as well as a set of machine learning models by using pandas/scikit-learn to make predictions.
